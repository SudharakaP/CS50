Once upon a time, there were four little pigs who lived in a four-byte
ASCII file.  The first little piggy was an H.  The second little piggy
was a T. The third little piggy was an H.  And the fourth little
piggy was a newline.

Presently came along David A. Huffman, and made a tree out of the
piggies' frequencies, per the figure below.

           4
       0 /   \
        /     \
       2       \ 1
    0 /  \ 1    \
     /    \      \
    1      1      2
   \n      T      H

Along came along the wolf, and knocked at the door, and said:

"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in."

To which one pig answered:

"No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin."

The wolf then answered to that:

"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your tree down."

Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and 
huffed; but he could not get the tree down. When he found that he could not, 
with all his huffing and puffing, blow the tree down, he asked:

"Little pigs, little pigs, who made this unbreakable tree?"

To which the pigs answered:

"A nice man named Huffman at MIT"

So the wolf went to Huffman next morning and asked,

"Oh David, Oh David, how do I break a binary tree"

"Find the root and do a huff puff and away" said Huffman.

The wolf went to the piggie frequency tree, found the root, did a huff & puff,
blew the tree down ate the four pigs.
